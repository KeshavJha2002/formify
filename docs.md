# A documentation of my progress

> Next Js setup finished along with installations of all the dependencies and installed prisma using `npm install prisma --save-dev`
> Installed `*zod*` which is a typescript first schema declaration and validation library.
> Setting up authentication using `clerk`
> Created a well designed folder structure for better navigation
> `next-themes` provides ThemeProvider to allow light/dark/system mode. Since it is a client side stuff, I used it in another component. 
> [ ] `DesignerContext`
